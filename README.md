Brief introdution of this challenge:
Answer type classification plays a key role in question answering, it aims to do, because identify the  expected answer type so that filter irrelevant information, which notably increases the performance of QA systems. A granular answer type classification is possible with popular Semantic Web ontologies such as DBepdia (~760 classes) and Wikidata (~50K classes). In this challenge, given a question in natural language, the task is to predict type of the answer using a set of candidates from a target ontology.

We present our appoarch to predict types from an ontology for questions. The workflow of our solution is below:
